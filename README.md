[WIP] Ouroboros3D: Image-to-3D Generation via 3D-aware Recursive Diffusion

## üè† [Project Page](https://costwen.github.io/Ouroboros3D/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03184)

TL;DR. _Ouroboros3D, a unified 3D generation framework, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions._

## üî® Method Overview

## Updata

- 2024-08-30: we released the training code, inference code, and model checkpoint of our baseline, Ouroboros3D.

## üîß Installation

Just one command to prepare training and test environments:
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparation for training

We render 2 16-frame RGBA orbits at 512 √ó 512. For each orbit, the cameras are
positioned at a randomly sampled elevation between [-5, 30] degrees. You can rendering any 

```Bash
|
|-- 0a0c7e40a66d4fd090f549599f2f2c9d # object id
| |-- render_0000.webp
| |-- ...
| |-- meta.json # meta info
|-- train.txt
|-- ...
```


After preparing the data, you can to modify the config file `configs/mv/svd_lgm_rgb_ccm_lvis.yaml` to meet your needs.

To train on one node, please use:
```Bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 train.py --config /path/to/your-config.yaml
```
or use 

```Bash
./run.sh train
```

You can modify the `run.sh` to meets your requirements.

During training, you will see the validation results in both `output_dir` and logger. You can choose `wandb` or `tensorboard`.

## Inference


```
python inference.py \
--config configs/baseline.yaml \
--ckpt /path/to/checkpoint \
--input_img testset/3D_Dollhouse_Lamp.webp \
--output_dir outputs \
--elevation 30 \
--seed 0 \
--device cuda
```
